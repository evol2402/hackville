# Serenify

## Inspiration

Mental health is a crucial yet often neglected aspect of student life. With the pressures of academics, deadlines, and personal challenges, students often face mental health issues that go unnoticed. To address this, we created **Serenify**, a platform that proactively supports students' mental well-being. Our goal is to provide consistent mental health support seamlessly integrated into students' daily routines.

## What it does

**Serenify** is a comprehensive platform designed to assess, track, and improve students' mental health in a simple, engaging manner:

### Features:
1. **Emotional Analysis**: 
   - Students upload a photo, and Serenify uses Computer Vision and DeepFace to assess their emotional state (e.g., happy, neutral, or unhappy).
   
2. **Chatbot Support**: 
   - Powered by the **Gemini API**, Serenifyâ€™s chatbot engages in meaningful conversations with students, offering personalized interactions and support.
   
3. **Daily Tips**: 
   - At the end of each interaction, students receive five actionable tips tailored to their emotional state, helping them improve their mood or stay motivated.
   
4. **Rewards System**: 
   - Students earn points for daily check-ins, which they can redeem for perks such as food court discounts, encouraging consistent engagement.
   
5. **Proactive Escalation**: 
   - For students displaying consistent signs of distress, Serenify can escalate their data to campus mental health teams or peer mentors for timely intervention.
